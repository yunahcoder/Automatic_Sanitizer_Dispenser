# Automatic_Sanitizer_Dispenser
A code that dispenses different amounts of hand sanitizer based on the size of the hand.

# Overview
Automatic hand sanitizer dispensers are often utilized in places like hospitals or restaurants for increased sanitation. However, these dispensers often fail to account for the various hand sizes in different age ranges. This results in too much or too little hand sanitizer dispensed varying from person to person, which can lead to waste and cause inconvenience. Too little might not kill all of the harmful bacteria, leading to possible health concerns. On the contrary, too much can have adverse side effects such as dried-out skin and the potential for being more susceptible to bacteria. The lack of accountability in size variations presents a need for a hand sanitizer dispenser that is capable of using image recognition to detect different hand sizes and dispense the right amount for each one, hence this code.
# Program Details
The open-source framework mediapipe was utilized in detecting different points on the hand, which allowed the area of the palm to be calculated in pixels using Heron's formula. 
# Material Information
The hand sanitizer stand and dispenser this code was created for was the PURELL ES6 Dispenser Floor Stand with ES6 Automatic Dispenser (https://www.amazon.com/PURELL-Dispenser-Floor-Stand-Graphite/dp/B08VD6H3BD?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=AVG3BI4EO2YS9)
